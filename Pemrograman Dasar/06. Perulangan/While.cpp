    while(std::cin >> kata) {
        std::cout << kata << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;

/* A stupid song I like:
I couldn't watch you kill yourseld any longer.
I cut the ending where you watch your world die.
I'll be restoring what you lost, and you will not stop me.

there was a heart here and we heard every beat of it; while we were sleeping every night, unlike you; so I will be bringing back the day, and you will not stop me.
and I understand if you thought it meant nothing at all
but as long as a soul could be heard in a song full of life, you can't fall


so it's here, the peaceful end of the night, begins again-
let your broken spirit run towards the comfort of the sun.
so the ice inside you will melt indefinitely.
try to set your sights for the world that you wish to see.

we'll try to help in any way we can.



we couldn't watch you fall apart any longer.
everything vanished in a blink of an eye.
repressed behind walls of solid glass, and sorrow too costly.

you put your love and your remorse into everything.
stories and memories spanning centuries wide.
and you could've halted everything, BUT YOU HAVE NOT STOPPED ME.

the sun through a window make even small differences count.
if the stillness of night can't appease talking walls in a room, then step out.


and it's here, the vocal end of your fears, will rise again.
it's time to take control of that world withing your soul-
so the wrath inside you will stop indefinitely.
until then, envision the world that you wish to see.

and we will help in any way we can.
and we will help in any way we can.
and we will help in every way we can.
