### Materials
- Metabolism
	- Catabolism (Protein; Peptide bond (C-N)) -> Hydrolysis (Lipid; Ester bond (C-O-C))
	- Anabolism (Protein; Peptide bond (C-N)) -> Condensation (Lipid; combine two; Ester bond (C-O-C); Glycosidic bond (The link between element have a circle in the middle of the link))
- Monosaccharide
	- Glucose
	- Fructose
	- Ribose
- How the scientific evidence for health risks of trans-fat and saturated fats?
	- Saturated fats and *trans* fats raise blood cholesterol levels, while (cis) unsaturated fats lower blood cholesterol levels.
	  
	  LDL (bad, increase cholesterol) is low-density lipoprotein = cair
	  HDL (good, decrease cholesterol) is high-density lipoprotein = beku
	  
	  lemak jenuh itu beku (punya ikatan 2; kalau 1 itu tidak jenuh); 
	  tidak jenuh (unsaturated) itu cair karena ikatannya longgar di suhu ruang (contohnya olive oil, salmon, umumnya berasal dari tumbuhan)
	  
	  isomer adalah molekul yang sama tapi strukturnya berbeda
	  
	  selama ini makanan kita lebih banyak LDL: roti, pisang, sayuran hijau, beras merah, gandum, kedelai, kacang2an, ikan salmon, alpukat
	  untuk HDL: telur, buah serat tinggi, ikan berlemak (tergantung pengolahan), kedelai[nV]
- How the extreme pH and heat influence protein?
	- Higher temperature and extreme pH may cause a protein to lose its structure and function and making it inactive
- BMI (Body mass weight)
	- Body weight in Kg divided by height in M squared
		- 45 / 1.7[squared] = 15.75575085

### Data based question: Emperor Penguins
#### a) Calculate the total mass loss for each group of birds.
- [x] i) wild
	(17.3 + 11.8 + 7.7 + 0.4) - (14.4 + 2.2 + 6.9 + 0.4) = 13.3 Kg
- [x] ii) captive
		(18.2 + 12 + 8 + 0.4) - (14.3 + 0.8 + 6.8 + 0.5) = 16.2 Kg
#### b) Compare the changes in lipid content of the captive birds with those of the birds living free in the colony.
- [x] the changes in lipids for the captive birds is more than those birds living free in the colony
- "because they don't cuddle up in dense crowd, making it less warm thus more lipids are gone"
#### c) Besides being used as an energy source, state another function of lipid which might be important for penguin survival.
lipids can be used to store energy ("long term"; in fat molecules; high dense ratio in energy:size), and that energy could be used when there's no input of energy from outer sources like foods
"glucose can also store energy, but it's much quicker process and for short-term"
### Data based question: Nomograms and BMI
#### 1 a) State the body mass index of a man who has a mass of 75 kg and a height of 1.45 metres.
75 Kg divided by 1.45 metre squared = 35.67181926
#### b) Deduce the body mass status of this man.
this man is considered *obese* by the BMI
#### 2 a) State the body mass of the person standing on the scales on the previous page.
the body mass of the person standing on the scales on the previous page is 100 kg
#### b) The person has a height of 1.8 metres. Deduce their body mass status.
100 kg divided by 1.8 metres squared = 30.86419753; he's *obese* :D
#### 3) A woman has a height of 150 cm and a BMI of 40. Calculate the minimum amount of body mass she must lose to reach normal body mass status. Show all of your working.
normal BMI status is 18.5 - 25.0
this woman's weight is 40 multiplied by 1.5 squared = 90 kg
for a woman of the height 150 cm, the most body mass one can have and still be considered as normal body mass status is 25 * 1.5 [squared] = 51.75 kg
90 kg - 51.75 kg = **38.25 kg**
#### b) Suggest two ways in which the woman could reduce her body mass.
do more exercises (to burn calories) and diets (to reduce the gains of calories)
#### 4) Outline the relationship between height and BMI for a fixed body mass.
when the value of height increases, the BMI scales inversely proportional by the power of 2
the opposite apply if the value of height decrease
